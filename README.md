[![WAVE: playlist, automation and the mixer. Click for the video.](site/img/hero.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtuHDyIQpYk)

WAVE is a desktop music production program (a DAW) for Windows and Linux. It is free, the
source is open, and it is made for one job: making a beat and recording
a vocal over it, the way you would in FL Studio.

## Note from developer (This part is not AI SLOP)

![From the first FL Studio in 2010 to WAVE in 2026](site/img/journey.svg)

- **2010:** I downloaded FL Studio for the first time and started making music.
- **2015:** I started music school: cello, guitar and piano (graduated in 2019).
- **2016–2022:** I sold beats to underground rappers in Poland (pop, true school, trap, love songs).
- Along the way I tried almost every genre (EDM, lo-fi, classical, my own pop songs), often with real instruments in my beats. I also run a YouTube channel and master the voice for it myself.
- **2022:** I joined Nokia, where I work on noise cancellation for telecom radios. That is a lot of DSP math, so I understand how sound works under the hood.

WAVE started as a fun experiment. I wanted a modern DAW where every instrument and effect
feels like part of the same application: they share the same controls and visualizations, a
new feature reaches the whole app at once, and you don't juggle a dozen different interfaces.
Yes, it is vibe-coded with Claude Fable, but I know what the code is doing.

There are already excellent open-source DAWs, and I'm not trying to replace them. I just
wanted a different workflow, and ended up using WAVE more than FL Studio itself.

## Why WAVE

**If you know FL Studio, you already know WAVE.** Patterns on a free playlist, a Channel Rack
with a step sequencer, a piano roll per channel. The gestures are the same too: right-click
deletes, middle-button drag pans, Ctrl+Q quantizes, Alt+wheel changes velocity. A beat plays
on the first press of Space.

**Recording and vocals are not an edition.** Loop recording with takes and comping, measured
latency compensation, a note-level pitch editor, live pitch correction, Tune to Reference
(pull a take onto a guide vocal), a vocal rider and a one-click vocal chain. All of it is in
the one free build.

**Every effect draws what it does to your audio.** The picture above the knobs comes from the
signal passing through, so you see the gain reduction or the added harmonics instead of
guessing. These were recorded in the app while a beat plays (drums, an 808, the piano and a
pluck, written through the `wave` command):

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><img src="site/img/comp-live.gif" alt="Compressor on the drum bus"><br><b>Compressor</b> on the drum bus. Left: the transfer curve with the threshold. Right: the level history, with the gain reduction drawn in red from the top.</td>
    <td width="50%"><img src="site/img/limit-live.gif" alt="Limiter on the master"><br><b>Limiter</b> on the master, pushed 7 dB into a −1 dBTP ceiling. The red band is what it takes off each peak.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="site/img/sat-live.gif" alt="Saturator on the drums"><br><b>Saturator</b> on the drums. The trace is input against output on the transfer curve; the pink layer in the spectrum is the harmonics the stage adds.</td>
    <td><img src="site/img/reverb-live.gif" alt="Reverb on the piano"><br><b>Reverb</b> on the piano. Each line is the tail at a later moment, across the spectrum; the orange surface is the decay the knobs ask for.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2"><img src="site/img/eq-live.gif" alt="Parametric EQ on the master"><br><b>Parametric EQ</b> on the master. The spectrum before and after moves under the curve you drag.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

All 14 plugin windows are on the [website](https://miskibin.github.io/wave-DAW/#plugins).

**An AI agent can work in the project you have open.** WAVE installs a `wave` command that
talks to the running app. The agent reads the song as JSON, writes notes and sets knobs on
your screen, then bounces offline and reads back peak, level and clipping, because it cannot
hear. Every command is one step in your undo history, so Ctrl+Z removes whatever you do not
like. [This trap beat](https://miskibin.github.io/wave-DAW/#listen) was made that way.

```sh
wave context --pretty                     # tracks, inserts, patterns, channels
wave pattern --id 2 --ch hat --steps "x.x. x.x. x.x5 x.x9"
wave add-fx --insert 6 --type reverb --preset 3
wave render --out check.wav --to 16       # offline bounce + level statistics
```

**The engine is written for the audio thread first.** The callback never allocates, locks or
touches a file (the benchmark counts allocations on the audio thread: zero). Moving a knob never rebuilds the graph.
Sixteen synth voices with two oscillators and seven-voice unison each, every effect on, take
about 17 % of one core at 48 kHz with 64-sample blocks, and the oscillators stay more than
60 dB above their aliasing up to C7 ([measurements](docs/synth.md)). How it is put together: [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md).

## WAVE and FL Studio, honestly

WAVE borrows FL Studio's way of working, so that is the fair comparison. FL Studio has more
than twenty-five years behind it and wins on breadth.

| | WAVE 0.9 | FL Studio |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Price | Free | About $99 to $450 depending on the edition |
| Source code | Open | Closed |
| Audio recording | Included, with takes and comping | Producer edition or higher |
| Vocal pitch editing | Included | NewTone and Pitcher come with the higher editions |
| Working with an AI agent | The agent edits the open project and measures its own renders | No command line into the open project |
| Built-in instruments and effects | 14 | More than a hundred across the editions |
| Third-party plugins | VST3 effects only; plugin windows on Windows only | VST instruments and effects, and more formats |
| Platforms | Windows and Linux | Windows and macOS |
| Maturity | Version 0.9, one developer, expect rough edges | Since 1998, large community, tutorials, sample packs |

FL Studio details as of November 2026; see Image-Line's edition comparison for current
prices. FL Studio is a trademark of Image-Line, and WAVE is not affiliated with it.

**Coming from Ableton Live?** The arrangement side will feel familiar. WAVE has no Session
view or clip launcher, so if you write by launching clips, it does not replace Live yet.

## Where it stands

Version 0.9, built by one person with AI agents. It covers a complete beat and a vocal
session. What it does not do yet:

- no VST instruments, only VST3 effects, and no CLAP or LV2; on Linux a VST3 effect is edited
  through WAVE's parameter list, because plugin windows work on Windows only;
- no macOS build;
- no Session view or clip launching;
- no import of FL Studio projects (`.flp`); bring stems or samples over instead;
- releases come often, so things still move. The [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) is written for
  musicians, not for developers.

## Questions people ask

**Is it really free?** Yes. There is one build, no paid edition and no account.

**Can it replace FL Studio?** For beats built from the built-in synth, the piano, samples and
your own recordings: yes, that is what it is made for. If your sound depends on VST
instruments such as Serum, or on FL's own plugins: not yet.

**Does it run on a Mac?** No. Windows and Linux (deb, rpm, AppImage) only.

**Do I need an AI agent to use it?** No. It is a normal DAW with a mouse and a keyboard. The
`wave` command is there if you want an agent, or your own script, to work in the project.

**Was it written by AI?** Mostly, yes, directed by a musician who works with DSP for a living;
see the note above. The engine has tests for clicks, aliasing and loudness that run on every
change, and a benchmark that counts allocations in the audio callback.

## Install

Download the installer from the [latest release](https://github.com/miskibin/wave-DAW/releases/latest).
The Windows build includes ASIO support (Settings → Audio → ASIO) and the WAVE Keys piano.
On Windows, double-click a `.wave` project in File Explorer to open it in WAVE.
If WAVE is already running, its window comes to the front and prompts you about any unsaved changes before switching projects.
Linux packages are attached to the same release.

To share an editable project, choose **File → Export project as ZIP**. Unzip the whole archive
and open the `.wave` file inside it. Keep the `Audio` folder beside the project. The ZIP includes
the project's samples and recorded takes. WAVE looks for third-party plugins at the locations
stored in the project. WAVE Keys uses its bundled or separately installed piano library.

## Build from source

Prerequisites: Rust stable, Node 22 + pnpm, and on Linux the WebKitGTK, ALSA, JACK and D-Bus
dev packages (`libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libasound2-dev libjack-jackd2-dev libdbus-1-dev`). JACK is
loaded at run time, so the app still starts on a machine without it.

```sh
pnpm --dir ui install
cargo install tauri-cli --version "^2"
cd app && cargo tauri dev
```

**ASIO (Windows):** build with the `asio` feature. It needs LLVM/Clang
(`winget install LLVM.LLVM`, then `LIBCLANG_PATH=C:\Program Files\LLVM\bin`); cpal downloads
the Steinberg SDK by itself.

```powershell
cd app; cargo tauri build --features asio
```

**WAVE Keys in your own build:** `node scripts/fetch-keys.mjs` downloads the piano (138 MB,
checksummed, cached in `target/keys-src`) and prepares it in `app/resources/keys` (cut to what
the app plays, 16-bit FLAC, about 23 MB) so `tauri build` ships it. It needs `cargo`. Without it the app offers to
download the piano the first time you add the instrument.

## The `wave` command line

It works as soon as the app has run once (open a new terminal). To let an agent such as
Claude Code work on your song, start it in any folder and tell it to run `wave context`.
Full reference: [`docs/cli.md`](docs/cli.md).

```sh
wave channels --keys                      # add the WAVE Keys piano
wave undo                                 # or press Ctrl+Z in the app
```
